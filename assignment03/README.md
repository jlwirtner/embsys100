# **Assignment 3**

## Problem 1
**a.)** Morse code is a form of character encoding. It translates text characters into squences consisting of two different durations of a "signal," called a dot or a dash. A dot is when the signal is high for one unit
of time, and a dash is when the signal is high for three units of time. The singal goes low for one unit of time between dots and dashes that are part of the same text chracter, three units of time between text chracters, 
and seven units of time between words.\\
**b.)** Samuel F.B. Morse invented morse code while developing an electric telegraph with Joesph Henry and Alfred Vail. Morse's initial system was intened to only encode numbers. Alfred Vail expanded it to include letters 
and special characters in 1840.\
